# Overview:
 The Objective of the project was to create an interactive and responsive portfolio landing page for Cache Bank.The project was completed with the use of various web languages, namely: Tailwind CSS, HTML5, JavaScript.

# Reflection:
 Overall, completing the project was interesting and it was made easier by the help of the youtube videos provided and the help pf the coaches. I made 2 minor design changes to the landing page to make it look neater and more presentable.

# Challenges faced:
 The only challenge i faced was the hiding function of the header content when the screen size and device become either medium or small, but i fixed the issue by adding a 'hidden' tailwind CSS element which then conflicted with the 'flex' initially added to the div
 Although the 2 elements conflicted the page functioned as intended after i added the 'hidden'.
